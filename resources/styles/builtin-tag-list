# There are a large number of tags names that 
# have become hardwired into mkgmap.  This is list
# of these tags.
#
# It only includes tags that are expected in the input file
# and not tags that might be added in a style file that are
# later recognised by mkgmap. In general these begin with the
# string 'mkgmap:'
